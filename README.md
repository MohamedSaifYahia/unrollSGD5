# Unlearning-Unrolling-SGD

Included is the relevant code for our work. The files are divided into their relevant experiments: Unlearning in the image domain (/Unlearning), training and unlearning BERT (/BERT), comparing Membership Inference to unlearning (/Membership inference) and Privacy Risk Score experiments (/Privacy_risk_score). Model definition files for resnet and vgg are in their appropriately named files. The miscellanous folder includes scripts on how to run each file.
